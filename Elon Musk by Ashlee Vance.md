## Chapter 1 : Elon's world

> "Do you think I'm insane?"
> ...
> It was only after I'd spent lots of time with Musk that I realised the questions was more for him than me.

> "I would like to die thinking humanity has a bright future", he said. If we can solve sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming multiplanetary species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet - to cope with a worst-case scenario happening and extinguishing human consciousness - then, I think that would be really good".

> "I think there are probably too many smart people pursing Internet stuff, finance, and law," Musk said on the way. "That is part of the reason why we haven't seen as much innovation."

> "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads," Jeff Hammerbacher, an early Facebook Engineer, told me.

> In 2005, Huebener delivered a paper, "A Possible Declining Trend in Worldwide Innovation" which was either an indictment of Silicon Valley or at least an ominous warning.  
> ...
> Man has already climbed past the trunk of the tree and gone out on its major limbs, mining most of the really big, game-changing ideas - the wheel, electricity, the airplane, the telephone, the transistor. Now, we're left dangling near the end of the branches at the top of the tree and mostly refining the past inventions.
> ...
> "I think the probability of us discovering another top-one-hundred-type invention gets smaller and smaller," Hubner told me in an interview. "Innovation is a finite resource."

> "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters" because the tagline of his venture capital firm Founders Fund, IN an essay called "What Happened to the Future," Thiel and his cohorts described how Twitter, its 140-character messages, and similar inventions have let public down. He argued that science fiction, which once celebrated the future, has turned dystopian because people no longer have an optimistic view of technology's ability to change the world.

> " To me, Eon is the shining example of how Silicon Valley might be able to reinvent itself and be more relevant than chasing these quick IPOs and focusing on getting incremental products out", said Edward Jung, a famed software engineer and inventor.

## Chapter 2. Africa
> "He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what question to ask", Musk said.

> "Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what question to ask".

> "The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment", he said.

> The Haldemans had a laissez-faire approach to raising their children, which would extend over generations to Musk. Their kids were never punished, as Joshua believed they would intuit their way to proper behavior. When mom and dad went off on their tremendous flights, the kids were left at home. Scott Haldeman can't remember his father setting foot at his school a single time even though his son was captain of the rugby team and a prefect. "To him, that was all just anticipated," said Scott Haldeman. "We were left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just have to make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very proud of Elon."

> As Musk saw it, "I just look at it as 'What grades do I need to get where I want to go?' ...
> There needs to be a reason for a grade.

## Chapter 3. Canada
> Outside of his studies, Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal, and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then take turns cold-calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch.

> "One night he told me, 'If there was a way that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat. I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.'"

> "When Elon gets into something, he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity."

> It feels as if Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way. But for Musk, the distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is important. Musk has long wanted the world to know that he's different from the run-off-the-mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He wasn't sniffing out trends, and he wasn't consumed by the ideal of getting rich. He's been in pursuit of a master plan all along. ...
> "I'm not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way."

## Chapter 4. Elon's first start-up
> Heilman also notices that the investors bought into Musks's slavish devotion to the company. "Even then, as essentially a college kid with zits, Elon had this drive that this thing - whatever it was - had to get done and that if he didn't do it, he'd miss his shot," Heilmann said. "I think that's what the VCs saw - that he was willing to stake his existence on building out this platform." Musk actually said as much to one venture capitalist, informing him, "My mentality is that of a samurai. I would rather commit seppuku than fail."

> "Really smart people sometimes don't understand that not everyone can keep up with them or go as fast," said Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist who would become Zip2's CRO.
